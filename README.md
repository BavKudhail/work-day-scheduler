# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## The Goal

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar ✅

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours ✅

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future ✅

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event ✅

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage ✅

WHEN I refresh the page ✅
THEN the saved events persist
```
